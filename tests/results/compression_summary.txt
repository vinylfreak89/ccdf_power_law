================================================================
OVERALL: Pattern appears in ~60-80% of crashes for most assets
SPX shows strongest pattern at 81%
Individual stocks (NVDA, AMZN, TSLA) show 61-68%
Crypto (BTC, ETH) shows 53-69%
Bonds/Commodities weaker (TLT 43%, GOLD 50%, SILVER 33%)
IWM (small caps) shows NO pattern (0%)

CONCLUSION:
The compression pattern (fewer moves than power law predicts) 
DOES occur before most crashes, especially for:
- Broad equity indices (SPX 81%)
- Individual growth stocks (60-70%)
- Crypto (60-70%)

Pattern is WEAKER for:
- Bonds/safe havens
- Small caps
- Commodities

This suggests the pattern is related to equity market dynamics
and concentration of flows, not a universal market law.
